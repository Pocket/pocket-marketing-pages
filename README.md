# Pocket Marketing Pages

## What
This repository holds [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) marketing pages in multiple locales. Netlify's [redirection engine](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/) takes care of locale redirects based on `Accept-Language` headers. The content is built using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator.

## Why
Seperation of concerns: Mozilla's Marketing team can update content of marketing pages without requiring Pocket Operations team's involvement.

## How
getpocket.com will transparently proxy requests to Netlify and return this content to the requesting user. E.g. 
 1. User with `Accept-Language: es` requests https://getpocket.com/about
 2. getpocket.com web server requests content from https://pocket-static-production.netlify.com/about/
 3. Netlify returns content from https://pocket-static-production.netlify.com/es/about/
 4. getpocket.com web server returns received content to User.

The sites generated by this repo are not supposed to be accessed directly but they don't need to be private. In this spirit `robots.txt` has been configured to prevent search engine indexing.
